My name is Alexandru-Victor Botorog and I am currently a Merit Scholar at **London Business School** (LBS) studying the Masters in Analytics and Management. Before LBS, I pursued a Bachelor in Economics at **University College London** (UCL). I graduated from this programme in the summer of 2022 with a [First Class Honours degree](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G-9Jsd779jrsFfhTX7nIn4ciRa3OmiWb/view?usp=sharing), having achieved an average mark of 77. Because I was ranked 8th out of the 250 students in my cohort, I was nominated to the [Dean's List 2022](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11qTCM9DK7WmqhfJJLYXDlDBcm3G_c0N6/view?usp=sharing), a distinction awarded only to the top 5% of UCL Economics graduates. 

I am a very capable problem solver with outstanding numerical and analytical skills. I have been refining these skills consistently over my lifetime through rigorous preparation in quantitative fields such as mathematics and physics during high school, or economics, statistics, and programming at university. I owe most of my skill development during high school to my participation and training for olympiads and other competitions in mathematics or physics. During those years, I won numerous county and national level awards, having qualified for 5 consecutive years (2014-2018) to the National Physics Olympiad and having won two bronze medals (2015, 2017).

Due to my natural aptitude for quantitative subjects and my interest for social, political, and business issues, I decided that economics would be the perfect subject to study as an undergraduate. The training I have received in economics taught me how to approach and solve real-world problems that might be encountered in business or public policy contexts. My passion for problem solving and corporate affairs eventually led me to apply for and pursue an internship at Roland Berger's Bucharest office during the summer of 2021. However, at UCL I also developed an even stronger interest for statistics, programming, and data science, and for how these tools can be used to solve the overly complex business and finance issues that modern companies face. To fully establish my expertise in this area, I decided to pursue the Masters in Analytics and Management at London Business School. Now that I am approaching the end of this programme, I believe I have developed a solid foundation in data science after successfully completing many projects that required me to conduct significant amounts of data cleaning and then implement advanced data mining algorithms.

My hobbies include playing chess, weight training at the gym, hiking, and playing sports such as volleyball, basketball, or tennis.
