At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main 

Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised

```{r read_GDP_data}
UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip
```

 The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.

```{r reshape_GDP_data, na.rm=TRUE}
tidy_GDP_data  <- pivot_longer(UN_GDP_data, cols=4:51, names_to="year", values_to="amount")%>%
  mutate(amount=amount/10^9)

plot1_GDP_data<-tidy_GDP_data%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from="IndicatorName", values_from="amount")

names(plot1_GDP_data)[4:11] <- c("Final consumption", "Household expenditure", "Government expenditure", "Gross capital formation", "Gross fixed capital formation", "Exports", "Imports", "Final GDP")
  
plot1_GDP_data<-plot1_GDP_data%>%
    pivot_longer(cols=4:20, names_to="IndicatorName", values_to="amount")%>%
    mutate(year=as.numeric(year))

plot1_GDP_data

# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
```

First, can you produce this plot?
```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/gdp1.png",error=FALSE)
```

```{r Chlg2plot1, out.width="100%"}
indicator_list=c("Household expenditure", "Government expenditure", "Gross capital formation", "Exports", "Imports")
plot1_GDP_data%>%
  filter(Country %in% country_list)%>%
  filter(IndicatorName %in% indicator_list)%>%
 ggplot(aes(x=year, y=amount))+geom_line(aes(colour=IndicatorName, group=IndicatorName))+facet_grid(~Country)+theme_bw()+scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010))+labs(title="GDP components over time", subtitle="In constant 2010 USD", y="Billion US$", x=element_blank(), color="Components of GDP")+
  theme(legend.key.size = unit(0.4, 'cm'), legend.text = element_text(size=6), legend.title = element_text(size=8))
```

Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

```{r GDP_by_comp, na.rm=TRUE}
plot2_GDP_data<-plot1_GDP_data%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from="IndicatorName", values_from="amount")%>%
  mutate(new_GDP=`Household expenditure`+`Government expenditure`+`Gross capital formation`+`Exports`-`Imports`)%>%
  mutate(new_vs_final=new_GDP/`Final GDP`-1)%>%
  mutate(`Household expenditure`=`Household expenditure`/new_GDP)%>%
  mutate(`Government expenditure`=`Government expenditure`/new_GDP)%>%
  mutate(`Gross capital formation`=`Gross capital formation`/new_GDP)%>%
  mutate(`Net exports`=(`Exports`-`Imports`)/new_GDP)

plot2_GDP_data

ggplot(plot2_GDP_data, aes(x=new_vs_final))+geom_histogram()+labs(title="Histogram of % difference between GDP calculated as the sum of its constituent componenets (C+I+G+NX) versus final reported GDP, all countries, 1970-2017", y="Count", x="% difference")
```

> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

The % difference between what we calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe represents the mismatch between the sum of the reported individual components of GDP—consumption, investment, government expenditure and net exports—and the reported figure for final GDP itself. Why this % difference arises for many countries and years is unclear since the two figures should be equal. Perhaps an important part of one of the four components has been left out in the case of some countries. 

Second plot to reproduce:
```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/gdp2.png",error=FALSE)
```

```{r Chlg2Plot2, out.width="100%"}
indicator_list=c("Household expenditure", "Government expenditure", "Gross capital formation", "Net exports")
plot2_GDP_data%>%
  pivot_longer(cols=4:23, names_to="IndicatorName", values_to="amount")%>%
  filter(Country %in% country_list)%>%
  filter(IndicatorName %in% indicator_list)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=amount))+geom_line(aes(colour=IndicatorName, group=IndicatorName))+facet_grid(~Country)+theme_bw()+scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010))+scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+labs(title="GDP and its breakdowns at constant 2010 prices in US dollars", y="proportion", x=element_blank(), caption = "Source: United Nations, https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads", color=element_blank())+
  theme(legend.key.size = unit(0.25, 'cm'), legend.text = element_text(size=5))
```

> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 

The last chart presents the evolution of the weight of the 4 primary GDP components (C, I, G, NX) in GDP itself. Therefore it only shows the relative performance of the components compared to other components from the same country. 

Over the last 50 years, the main dynamic that can be observed in Germany is that net exports have significantly risen as a proportion of GDP since the year 2000, when the euro was introduced. This is hardly surprising since it is a well known fact that the introduction of the euro has benefited the German economy and its trade surplus enormously, at the expense of other EU economies such as Italy or Greece. 

In India, the main trend is that investment has grown while consumption has fallen as percentages of GDP. This is most likely due to the economic liberalization that commenced in the 1990s, which has brought huge inflows of foreign investments. However, most of the population remains extremely poor, so consumption was the relative loser. 

In the US, net exports have fallen as a percentage of GDP while consumption expenditure has increased. This is because over the last 30 years the US has become a debtor nation which runs a trade deficit against other nations, especially China. However, consumer spending has been permanently encouraged through low interest rates and fiscal deficits. Investments have also performed relatively well, mostly due to the internet revolution that began in the 1990s. Another reason why investments probably performed well while government expenditure poorly since the 1990s is due to the shift towards supply side economics that has occurred in the US since Ronald Regan.
